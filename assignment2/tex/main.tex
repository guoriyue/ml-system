\maketitle

By the end of this project, you'll have real experience making transformer inference go brr. Specifically, we're taking Karpathy's wonderful nanoGPT implementation,\footnote{\url{https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT}} and improving GPT2 throughput by 10x and latency by 2x! But first, we'll do some theory. \\

At the end, you'll need to submit the following files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item model.py to the code section of Project-1 on Gradescope
    \item Pdf file with your written responses to the written part of Project-1 on Gradescope. 
\end{itemize}

The assignment should be completable with Google Colab. We understand that some students may require financial assistance for Colab. Please reach out to the teaching staff if this is a major challenge for you and we will try our best to resolve.
