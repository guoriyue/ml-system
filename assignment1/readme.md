# CS 229S :   Project-0

## Problem 1: Programming Transformers 
   Submit the lm.py file and the prgram_transformer_ar.ipynb files. Run the notebook using [Google Colab](https://colab.google/)

## Problem 3: Faster Conv 1D in CUDA:
   submit the conv1d_cuda.cu file. 
   
   To run your code, use conv1d.ipynb to connect to a free T4 GPU on [Google Colab](https://colab.google/). The notebook allows you to connect to your Google Drive, where you can move your src code and then execute from the notebook. This [tutorial](https://cs231n.github.io/assignments2023/assignment1/) explains a similar workflow.

Fill in the kernel in conv1d_cuda.cu, you are free to modify the kernel function and its signature but do not modify any other functions. Run the test.py file once you are done to make sure that your output is correct. Make sure you can see a table that compares your speedups to torch.
